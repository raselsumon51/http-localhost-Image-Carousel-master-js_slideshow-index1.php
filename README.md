### Project Overview

Title: _"Image Carousel"_

> GitHub: [link](https://github.com/albchia/Image-Carousel.git)

This project has been inspired by [@Dev Ed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q). I decided to pick his tutorial as training and inspiration to create my own image slider working with the basic elements of `HMTL`, `CSS` boostering also some `JS` concepts.
